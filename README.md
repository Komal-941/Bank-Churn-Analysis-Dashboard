Encoded categorical variables for effective visualization.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Conducted EDA using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Identified patterns in churn behavior by age groups, credit scores, and geography.

**Plots used:**
Pie Charts: Customer distribution by churn, country, and credit card ownership.
Bar Charts: Product usage vs. credit score and gender distribution by country.
Line Plot: Churn trends across age bins.

**Data Visualization and Dashboard Development:**

Used dynamic filters for churn labels and gender.
Displayed critical metrics such as churn rate, customer distribution, and activity status. 

### **📊 Key Insights:**
- Overall Churn Rate: 20.37% with 2,037 customers lost.
- Country Analysis: Spain shows the highest churn rate among the countries analyzed.
- Credit Score Impact: Lower credit scores are linked to a higher likelihood of churn.
- Activity Analysis: Inactive users significantly contribute to customer churn.

### 💡 Conclusion and Business Impact:
